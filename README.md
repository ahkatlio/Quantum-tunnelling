# Quantum-tunnelling
Quantum tunneling is a quantum mechanical phenomenon where a particle can pass through a potential barrier even though it does not have enough energy to do so classically. 
In Qiskit it can be simulated by using the Quantum Circuit and Quantum Register classes to build the circuit for the system and then using the Quantum Simulator to run the simulation.
